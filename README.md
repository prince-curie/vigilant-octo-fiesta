# Decentralized Library - Casper Inc

_Casper Inc is a startup company that wants to harness the power of web3 to implement a Decentralized Library. It aims at allowing its users to share files and storage their data._

## Problem Statement

_They would like to:_
1. _Create a "Web3 Platform", which would be used by customers or users to do the following:_
    -   _Upload Files_
    -   _Retrieve Files_
    -   _Share files_ 
2. _Design and Implement a MVP Prototype to showcase the customers requirements._

## Task
_Build a  prototype that has all of the above features and using the ERC 721 standard to connect to the frontend._

## Solution

_The team had a meeting to ideate on the problem and after a successful meeting, we came up with some solutions but had to drill down to one because of several factor such as time available for the project._

<!-- _We have created two smart-contracts one upload files to IPFS and using the hash gotten from the service use it to store it on the blockchain, while the other would be to use retrieve the saved data from the blockchain._ -->
